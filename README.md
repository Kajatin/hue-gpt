## Stack

### Firebase

The backend is powered by [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) which is used to store the generated images in Firebase Storage and the related metadata in Firestore. If you want to run the project yourself, you'll need to add your own Firebase project and add the credentials to `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_CONFIG` environment variable.

### OpenAI

Image generation is done using [DALLÂ·E](https://openai.com/product/dall-e-2) API. The generated images are then processed to extract dominant colors. You need to set your OpenAI API key in `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.

### Philips Hue

You also, of course, will need a Philips Hue setup with a bridge and at least one light. You should register your app with the bridge and add the credentials to the `HUE_APP_KEY` and the URL of the bridge to `HUE_BASE_URL` environment variables. You can get started with the [official guide](https://developers.meethue.com/develop/hue-api-v2/getting-started/).
